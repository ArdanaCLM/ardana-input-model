<p><b>Node roles</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Control Plane, includes Deployer node (3 nodes)</li>
  <li>Ironic Compute (just 1 node)</li>
</ul>

<p>This cloud model requires the following networks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>IPMI/iLO network, connected to the deployer and the IPMI/iLO ports of all servers
- External API - This is the network that users will use to make requests to the cloud</li>
  <li>Management - This is the network that will be used for all internal traffic
  between the cloud services. This network is also used to install and configure the
  controller nodes. This network needs to be on an untagged VLAN.</li>
  <li>Provisioning - This is the network used to PXE boot the ironic nodes and install the
  operating system selected by tenants. This network needs to be tagged (trunked) on
  the switch for control plane/ironic compute nodes. For ironic baremetal nodes, VLAN
  configuration on the switch will be set by neutron driver.</li>
  <li>Tenant VLANs - The range of VLAN IDs should be reserved for use by Ironic and
  set into cloud configuration. It is configured as untagged on control plane nodes,
  therefore it can't be combined with Management network on the same network interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following access should be allowed by routing/firewall:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Access from Management network to IPMI/iLO (used during Ardana installation and during
  ironic baremetal node provisioning).</li>
  <li>Access from Management network to swicth management network (used by neutron driver)</li>
  <li>EXTERNAL\_API network must be reachable from the tenant networks if you
  want bare metal nodes to be able to make API calls to the cloud.</li>
</ul>
